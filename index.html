			Hello, My name is Nik Rinck and I am the owner/operator of this website. I am currently a highschool senior in the Computer Programing & Game Design/ I.T. Acadamy Lab at Four County Career Center in Archbold, Ohio on State Route 34. In this lab I have created games, learned computer languages, and learned how to build a PC system through a cross lab course with the other computer lab. My future is bright with many opertunites from my lab and the fact that I.T. is a fastly growing job market. I can earn many certificiates and awards in my lab to ensure my success in the near and distant future. I have learned  to hone my creative spark in order to solve complex problems relating to I.T.and how to manage different types of computer systems like linix,windows,mac, and more. Thanks for reading my little intro paragraph :)
