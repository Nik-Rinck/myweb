				I am a highschool student, so I don't have much free time to do what I love for extended periods of time,
				but when I do have free time I like to do the things in the main center section. I am usually busy with 4-H,
				homework, four county's sports team every T day of the week, and other miscellaneous things that take up
				my time.

				<h3>Main Content</h3>
				<p>I play lots of video games. I love the open world type of games that have different endings that let
				you decide your fate. I enjoy many generes of games, but my top five video/board games are Skyrim,
				Talismen, Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Minecraft, and Saints Row 4. I also enjoy many youtube and
				twitch creators. MXR, Gawr Gura, CaptianSauce, Snuffy, McNasty, and Sean_VR are just a few people
				I enjoy watching. </p>
